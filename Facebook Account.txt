write an algorithm to find sum and average of three numbers

step 1: start
step 2: declare number1, number2, number3, sum, average
step 3: read the values into number1, number2, number3
step 4: calculate sum off three numbres using the formula<--number1+number2+number3
step 5: print sum
step 6: calculate average of three numbers using the formula<--(number1+number2+number3)/3
step 7: print average
step 8: stop
