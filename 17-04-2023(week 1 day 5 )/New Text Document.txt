write an algorithm to find wether an year is a leap year or not
 

 start
 read the year
 if (year%4==0)
        print "the given year is a leap year"
    else
        if((year%100==0)&& (year%400==0))
             print "the given year is a leap year"
        else
        print "the given year is not a leap year"
end
