step 1: start
step 2: declare the marks of aptitude_marks reasoning_marks, candidate_percentage
step 3: read the academic marks of aptitude_marks, reasoning_marks 
step 4: calculate the candidate_percentage using the formula<--((aptitude_marks+reasoning_marks)/200)*100
step 5: if the candidate_percentage is greater than 70%
             print candidate is eligible for admission
        else
