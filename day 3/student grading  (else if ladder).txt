Write an algorithm to input marks of five subjects Physics, Chemistry, Biology,     Mathematics and Computer. Calculate percentage and grade according to     following:
    Percentage >= 90% : Grade A
    Percentage >= 80% : Grade B
    Percentage >= 70% : Grade C
    Percentage >= 60% : Grade D
    Percentage >= 40% : Grade E
    Percentage < 40% : Grade F


ELSE IF LADDER

step1 :start
step2 :declare the variables Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics and Computer,percentage
step3 :read the values Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics and Computer
step4 :percentage marks of five subjects is percentage -->(Physics+Chemistry+Biology+Mathematics+Computer)/500*100
step6 :if Percentage >= 90% print Grade A
       else if 
            Percentage >= 80% print Grade B
       else if 
            Percentage >= 70% print Grade C
       else if 
            Percentage >= 60% print Grade D
       else if 
            Percentage >= 40% print Grade E
       else if 
            otherwise print grade F
step6 :stop
