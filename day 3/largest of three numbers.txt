Write the algorithm to find largest of three numbers

step1: start
step2: input the numbers as num1,num2,num3
step3: if num1 is greater than num2 and num1 is greater than num3
step4: print num1 is bigger
step5: if num2 is greater than num3 and num2 is greater than num1
step6: print num2 is greater
step7: else
step8: print num3 is graeter
step9: stop
