collections is used to temporarily store data
database is used to store data permenantly

file system has several disadvantages they are
security
data redundancy(duplication)
data isolation
data dependence(application programs are not independent)
applications are dependent on how the data is stored and how the data is accessed 
concurrent access anamolies(simultaneous accessing of data i.e if more than one user tries to access the data several problems may arise)

CREATE TABLE <table_name>

(

<attribute1> <data-type1>  [contraint1],

           <attribute2> <data-type2>  [contraint2],

           <attribute3> <data-type3>  [contraint3],

         ……………………………………….

           ………………………………………..

           <attributen> <data-typen>  [constraint n],

[table contraint1],

           …………………………………………..

           …………………………………………..

           [table constraint n]

);

has context menu
Compose

truncate deletes the data in the table but doesnt delete the table
drop deletes entire table and the data in the table
