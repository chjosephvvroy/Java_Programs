write the algorithm to find simple intrest

step1: start
step2: declare principle, time, rate of intrest, simple intrest
step3: read the values into principle, time, rate of intrest, simple intrest
step 4: calculate simple intrest using the formula<--(principle*rate of intrest*time)/100
step 5: print simple intrest 
step 6: stop

Bracket needs to be included in case of calculating average simple interest
