write an algorithm for printing 10 to 1 in descending order

output
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1


step 1: start 
step 2: declare count
step 3: assign value 10 into count
step 4: print count=10
step 5: decrement count by one(count=count-1)
step 6: repeat the steps 4 and 5 until it reaches 
count values (count>=1) or (count>0)
step 7: stop
