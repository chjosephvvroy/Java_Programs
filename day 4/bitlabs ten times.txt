write an algorithm to print bitlabs 10 times

step 1: start 
step 2: declare count
step 3: assign the count value 1 to count variable
step 4: print bitlabs
step 5: incrementing count value by 1 and store the count value into count (count=count+1)
step 6: repeat step 4 and 5 intil it reaches count valuep is greater than 10
(count<10)
step 7: stop
