how to write algorithm for printing 1 to 10 numbers in ascending order

output:
1
2
3
4
5
6
9
7
8
9
10



step 1: start
step 2: delclare a variable count
step 3: assign value into count
step 4: print count
step 5: increment count by one(count=count+1)
step 6: repeat the steps 4 and 5 until it reaches count values (count<=10) or count value reaches(count<11)
step 7: stop
