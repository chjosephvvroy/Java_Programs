explanation of my name is sowjanya * 5 times

step1:start
step2:declare count
step3:assigning the value 1 to count variable (count=1)
step4:print "myname is sowjanya"
step5:incrementing count value by 1 and store the value into count (count =count+1)
step6: check the condition(count<=5) if count value is greater than 5. if it is not repeat step 4 and 5 until it reaches count value is greater than 5 (count<5)
step7:stop
 
Iteration 1:
count =1
print my name is sowjanya
count=1+1-->2
2<5 -->
 
Iteration2:
my name is sowjanya
count=2+1-->3
3<5-->
 
Iteration3:
my name is sowjanya
count=3+1-->4
4<5
 
Iteration4:
my name is sowjanya
count=4+1=5
5<=5
 
Iteration 5:
my name is sowjanya
count=5+1-->6
6<5
 


when count=1 then                when count=0 then
count<=5                         count<5





count=1
count<=10 
count<11

count=0
count<10
count<=9
