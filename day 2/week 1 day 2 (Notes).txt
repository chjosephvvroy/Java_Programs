problem solving technique
we need to understand the problem 
identify the possible solutions
finding best solution for the problem 

finding area of rectangle
area of rectangle 
length*breadth
length=value
breadth=value


3 tools are used for problem solving
algorithm
flowchart
pseudocode

definition: algorithm step by step procedure to solve a problem is called algorithm

3 steps required to write algorithm
input 
process 
output




charecterstics of an algorithm
1.input-should accept atleast one input
2.output-should produce atleast one output 
3.Definiteness-each instruction must be clear and unambiguous
4.finiteness-algorithm should terminate in a finite number of steps
5.effectiveness-program must be executed within less time and less space
