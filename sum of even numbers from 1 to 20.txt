write the algorithm to find the sum of even number from 1 to 20

step1: start
step2: declare i, sum,
step3: assign i=1, sum=1,
step4: perform the steps (i)-(iii) until i<=20
       i.)i%2==0
          print number is even
          else print number is not even
       ii.)i=i+1
       iii.)sum=sum+i
step5: print sum
step6: stop
