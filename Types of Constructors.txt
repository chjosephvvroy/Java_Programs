If you apply static keyword with any method, it is known as static method.
ØA static method belongs to the class rather than the object of a class.
ØA static method can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of a class.
ØA static method can access static data member and can change the value of it.

ØThe static method can not use non static data member or call non-static method directly.
Øthis and super cannot be used in static context.
