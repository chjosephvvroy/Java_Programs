problem solving technique
we need to understand the problem 
identify the possible solutions
finding best solution for the problem 

finding area of rectangle
area of rectangle 
length*breadth
length=value
breadth=value


3 tools are used for problem solving
algorithm
flowchart
pseudocode

definition: algorithm step by step procedure to solve a problem is called algorithm

3 steps required to write algorithm
input 
process 
output

tea making 
input- sugar, milk, teapowder
process- boiling
output- tea

algorithm for making tea
step 1: start
step 2: take the ingredients
step 3: we have to add all the ingredients into the bowl
step 4: boiling
step 5: after boiling is done, we will get tea
step 6: stop



charecterstics of an algorithm
1.input-should accept atleast one input
2.output-should produce atleast one output 
3.Definiteness-each instruction must be clear and unambiguous
4.finiteness-algorithm should terminate in a finite number of steps
5.effectiveness-program must be executed within less time and less space 


step 1: start 
step 2: insert ATM card into the machine by slot given
step 3: choose language of choice 
step 5: enter the Pin
step 5: select deposit or withdrawl
step 6: enter required amount
step 7: Take back the card
step 8: stop 



step 1: start
step 2: soak rice in water
step 3: Marinate chicken cut pieces with required amount of spices
step 4: let it rest for atleast 30-45 minutes
step 5: partially cook the rice 
step 6: partially cook the chicken
step 7: add the partially cooked rice into the partially cooked chicken
step 8: let the rice and chicken cook until rice grain is dry on low flame
step 9: garnish with ghee roasted almonds and cashews 
step 10: serve hot
step 11: stop
